# FAST MENU DINING CALENDAR
My school's dining API was a little slow, so I decided to make my own! 

Well, for now it's a static json that I put together for about a months worth of menu item data (see [Dining Hall Calendar Scraper](https://github.com/JadonLee8/DiningHallCalendar), but I'm currently working on getting it going for much longer time periods and with periodic updates to handle menu item changes on their end.
